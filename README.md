# Generalising Dot Maps

This is part of my bachelor project. I created an algorithm to update a web-based marker/dot map on every pan and zoom such that the overall distribution is clearly visible, no matter the screen size or zoom level.

[Try it out here](https://sarah37.github.io/dotmaps/) [or here with a couple of options to visualise the algorithm (slower)](https://sarah37.github.io/dotmaps/test/)
